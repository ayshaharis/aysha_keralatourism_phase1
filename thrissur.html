Thrissur is built around a hillock on which the famous Vadakkunathan Temple is situated.  Although the Zamorins and Tippu have ruled here, Sakthan Thampuran was the architect of the modern day Thrissur and the one who converted Thrissur into a commercial center.Thrissur is often referred to as ‘the pooram city’.  The architectural design of the city also worths special mentioning as it was envisioned by  Sakthan Thampuran, the ruler of erstwhile Cochin state. City located around a small hillock mounted by the Vadakkumnathan temple can be seen  scientifically planned.  Actually the city is built around the vast open space called ‘Thekkinkadu maidanam’ surrounding the centrally located Vadakkumnatha temple.Around the maidan lies the ‘Swaraj Round’, the circular ring road, with several radial roads starting from it. The raised centre and the slopes starting from there are surrounded by green, fertile wetlands used for cultivating paddy.
